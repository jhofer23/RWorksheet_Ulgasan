#On this day, July 14, the majority of the other opinions are negative. This suggests that on that specific day, some topics or events led to negative attitudes.

#Even if all attitudes grew on this day, July 15, the level of unfavorable feeling is still the highest. This implies that something occurred on that day that led to negative emotions.

#Positive and neutral attitudes are mostly unchanged on these days, although negative attitudes are still predominant on July 17 and July 18.

#All emotions peaked on July 20 even if there were still more unfavorable feelings among the others. This means the day was a blank slate for events.

#On this day, July 21, all emotions are more intense, with the negative continuing to rule. This can imply that something happened on that specific day that caused people to respond badly.

#We can draw the conclusion from this evidence that public opinion is influenced by outside factors and evolves over time.
